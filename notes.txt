- convergence of dsy slows down near the boundary
    - be quantitative about it (fitting)
    - superconv -> (crossover?) -> power 1~2?
- asymptotics of the growths of the derivatives
    - confirm Luque or disprove
- (next step) dissipative standard map

- crossover as you go from one asymptotic behavior to another in renormalization
